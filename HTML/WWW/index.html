            <h2>What is World Wide Web?</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and are accessible via the Internet. It enables the retrieval and display of text, images, videos, and other multimedia content, interconnected via hyperlinks and URLs.</p>

            <h2>History of World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web was invented by British computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. He proposed the idea of a global hypertext system to facilitate information sharing among researchers. The first web browser, WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus), and the first web server were developed in 1990.</p>

            <h2>How World Wide Web Works</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web operates on a client-server model. Web browsers act as clients, sending requests to web servers for web resources such as HTML documents, images, or videos. Web servers process these requests and respond with the requested resources, which are then rendered by the browser for the user to view.</p>
